{{< figure src="/images/me.jpg" title="Victor Hugo - Software Engineer" >}}

I am the one in the middle enforcing engeering principles to design, develop, maintain, test, and evaluate computer software. I am also a photographer, a hobbyist, and I love to travel.

I am currently working as a Software Reliabiliy Engineer at [lastminute.com](https://www.lastminute.com/) with almost 10 years of experience in the field.

As a seasoned software engineer, I possess extensive experience working on large-scale, multilayered, and distributed applications across a variety of industries, including e-commerce, telecommunications, health, financial, and aviation. With a proven track record of success, I am adept at solving complex problems with precision and quality, while consistently meeting project deadlines. Additionally, I possess excellent collaboration skills and I am comfortable working with globally distributed teams.

My objective with this blog is to share my knowledge and experience with the community. I hope you enjoy it!
